## Communicating on the web
When two computers communicate with each other, they need to use the same rules.
This "language" that computers use is called a <bold>protocol</bold>.  The most popular protocol for web communication is <bold>HTTP</bold>, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

##HTTP Requests and Responses
At the heart of HTTP is a simple request-response system. The 'requesting' computer, also know as the 'client', asks another computer for some information. That computr, 'the server' sends back a response with the information that was requested.
